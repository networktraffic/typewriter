# notes
a) in order to use this in studio, you can create a modulescript and put the `src.lua` for the source
b) if you want to use this for exploit script development, just simply make a httpget request to the raw `src.lua` file or make a function within the script and call it from there

# basic usage
```lua
typewriter("this is an example!", 5)
```
